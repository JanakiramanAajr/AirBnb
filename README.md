## Problem Statement

The project focuses on analyzing Airbnb data to understand pricing dynamics, availability patterns, and location-based trends in the travel and property management industry. The objectives include establishing a MongoDB connection, cleaning and preparing the dataset, developing interactive visualizations using Streamlit, and creating dynamic plots to gain insights.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is hosted on MongoDB Atlas. It includes collections for Airbnb listings, reviews, and users. The structure of the data includes fields such as listing ID, title, description, host details, location coordinates, pricing, availability, amenities, ratings, and reviews.

## Approach

1. **MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval:** Establish a connection to MongoDB Atlas and retrieve the Airbnb dataset using pymongo library.
   
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Handle missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions to ensure data integrity and consistency for analysis.
   
3. **Geospatial Visualization:** Develop a Streamlit web application to visualize the distribution of Airbnb listings across locations using interactive maps.
   
4. **Price Analysis and Visualization:** Analyze price variations based on location, property type, and seasons. Create dynamic plots and charts for exploring price trends.
   
5. **Availability Analysis by Season:** Analyze availability patterns and occupancy rates across seasons. Visualize demand fluctuations using suitable visualizations.
   
6. **Location-Based Insights:** Extract and visualize data for specific regions or neighborhoods to gain insights into location-based trends.
   
7. **Interactive Visualizations:** Develop dynamic and interactive visualizations with filtering options to enable users to explore the data interactively.
   
8. **Dashboard Creation:** Utilize Power BI or Tableau to create comprehensive dashboards combining various visualizations to present key insights from the analysis.
